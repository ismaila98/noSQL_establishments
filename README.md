# noSQL_establishments
------------------------------------

### Overview
------------

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. We've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

- NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb: In this notebook, we'll be performing some modifications for the database before we can perform any queries or analysis for them. 

- NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb: Eat Safe, Love Magazine has specific questions they want us to answer, which will help them find the locations they wish to visit and avoid. We'll be performing the appropriate analysis in this notebook to answer these questions.
